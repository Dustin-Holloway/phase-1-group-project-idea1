This product was built using the Bikeindex registry API https://bikeindex.org/documentation/api_v3

The idea behind the project is to create a user platform to allow for localized search parameters, used to brows stolen bicycles within a focused proximity.

The user will be able to input a valid zipcode which will then fetch information from the BI registry.  After submitting the zipcode, the user should be able to click through or scroll through the returned results.
